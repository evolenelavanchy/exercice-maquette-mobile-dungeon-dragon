            Season 3 of Stranger Things—the Netflix show brought to you by the
            Duffer Brothers—released on July 4th. We won't spoil exactly what
            dangers the kids (and frankly, the entirety of Hawkins, Indiana)
            faced this year, although suffice to say that a mind flayer (of
            sorts) rears its head. And of course, you can also expect a fair
            amount of Dungeons & Dragons play... or at least attempted, with
            everything else going on!
          </p>

            If you've followed the show, you know how D&D plays a major role in
            the lives of these characters.If you played the game yourself back
            in the 1980's, or interested to see what's underway with the game
            today, read on!
